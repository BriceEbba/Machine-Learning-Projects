### Project Title:
**Student Exam Performance Prediction System**

### Project Description:
The **Student Exam Performance Prediction System** is an end-to-end machine learning project designed to predict students' math scores based on demographic and academic factors. This project employs a machine learning model trained on various features such as gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, and more to forecast the exam outcomes.

The system integrates a user-friendly web interface created with HTML and Flask, where users can input their details and receive predicted scores instantly. This application aims to assist educators and students in identifying potential academic outcomes and facilitating targeted educational support.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: For backend processing and machine learning model implementation.
- **Flask**: Used as a micro web framework to serve the application's backend.
- **HTML**: For structuring the web page and capturing user inputs.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes predictive modeling to estimate student performance.

### Web Page Details:
The web application allows users to input their demographic and academic information via a form. This data includes:
- Gender
- Race or Ethnicity
- Parental Level of Education
- Lunch Type
- Test Preparation Course
- Writing and Reading Scores

Upon submission, the Flask server processes the data through a trained model to predict the student's math score, which is then displayed on the web page.

### Setup and Installation:
To run this project locally and ensure that all dependencies do not affect your global Python installation, you can create a virtual environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Replace `project_url` with your actual GitHub repository URL:
   ```bash
   git clone project_url.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd project_directory
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   For Windows:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
   For macOS and Linux:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   On Windows:
   ```bash
   env\Scripts\activate
   ```
   On macOS and Linux:
   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

5. **Install the required Python packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Run the Flask application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

7. **Open a Web Browser**:
   Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to use the application.

8. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment** (when done):
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```
